# Report
The libraries I have used are Firebase realtime database and PhilJay MPAndroidChart.
I have used Bar Chart for report feature.
I have saved the JSON data in a text file and then uploaded it to Firebase realtime database and from there I have used it's values for Bar chart.
I have added a butten named "REPORT" on clicking it the Bar chart will be shown with current investment value at specific dates.
I have used a fragment for showinf bar chart and other neccessary information like initial investment value, month and year for the dates shown in graph at X-axis.
